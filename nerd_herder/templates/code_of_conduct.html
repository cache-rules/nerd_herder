                <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

                <p>
                    PuPPy is a Seattle-area Meetup made up of a mixture of
                    professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on
                    every aspect of the mission &mdash; including mentorship, teaching
                    and connecting people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to
                    communication issues. To support a welcoming environment for all,
                    regardless of individual differences, we have a few ground rules
                    that we ask people to adhere to when they participate in this
                    community activities. These rules apply equally to founders,
                    organizers, moderators, sponsors, and affiliates &mdash; in short,
                    to all participants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you must do, or can’t
                    do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended. It’s a
                    guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical
                    communities in which we participate, and which we represent.
                </p>

                <h2>The principles</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Be friendly and welcoming. We strive to be a community that
                        welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
                        This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race,
                        ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status,
                        social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
                        orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
                        status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
                        ability.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but
                        disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
                        We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we
                        cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
                        It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
                        uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of
                        the Python community should be respectful when dealing with
                        other members as well as with people outside the community.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of
                        professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be
                        kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants,
                        individually or as a group. Harassment and other exclusionary
                        behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited
                        to:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Violent threats or language directed against another
                                person.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Discriminatory jokes and language.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s
                                personally identifying information
                                (&quot;doxing&quot;).
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Personal insults, especially those using racist or
                                sexist terms.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Unwelcome sexual attention.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above
                                behavior.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone
                                asks you to stop, then stop.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Where does the code of conduct apply</h2>

                <p>

                    This includes:

                    <li>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Slack

                    <li>
                        Mailing lists
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        GitHub
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Any other forums created by the community used for
                        communication.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may
                    affect a person’s ability to participate within them.
                </p>

                <h2>Sponsors, affiliates, and exhibitors</h2>

                <p>
                    When you sponsor a PuPPy event, we welcome you as a member of
                    our community, and we expect you to be respectful to the community
                    you operate within.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or
                    similar activities are also subject to the code of conduct. In
                    particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images,
                    activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
                    must not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise
                    create a sexualized environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, sponsors and affiliates of conference, meetups, and
                    online activities should not employ aggressive recruiting
                    techniques, invasive marketing behavior, or similar actions towards
                    community members. In case of violations, sponsors might be
                    sanctioned and expelled from the event or activity with no return
                    of the sponsorship contribution.
                </p>

                <h2>What to do in case of violations</h2>

                <p>
                    If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct during
                    one of our events, please contact a member of the event staff
                    immediately. Event staff are introduced at the beginning of every event, but if
                    you missed the introduction or cannot find a staff member please reach out
                    to one of the staff members listed on the
                    <a href="/code-of-conduct-reporting-guide">Reporting Guide</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct in one of
                    our online platforms, we ask that you report it by emailing
                    <a href="mailto:conduct@pspython.com">conduct@pspython.com</a>.
                    To help us respond in the best way to the situation, please follow
                    the
                    <a href="/code-of-conduct-reporting-guide">Code of Conduct Reporting Guide</a>.
                    The code of conduct representatives employ the

                        Playbook</a> to handle reports.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases a
                    public statement might be required (for example in a
                    CoC transparency report following an event), but
                    these reports are anonymized and do not include any
                    personally identifying information.
                </p>
