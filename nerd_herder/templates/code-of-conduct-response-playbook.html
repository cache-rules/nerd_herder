                <h1>Code of Conduct Response Playbook</h1>

                <p>
                    This document aims to help organizers and moderators of PuPPy
                    spaces to handle reports of
                    <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> violations.
                </p>

                <h2>CoC violations at PuPPy events</h2>

                <h3>Presentations</h3>

                <p>
                    Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time
                    gaffes or minor problems, although a member of the volunteer staff
                    should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take
                    immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or
                    event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment
                    policy. For example, simply say &quot;I’m sorry, this presentation
                    cannot be continued at the present time&quot; with no further
                    explanation.
                </p>

                <h3>In-person reports</h3>

                <p>
                    When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you
                    should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken
                    seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions
                    the organizers will take.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered
                    it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them provide it if
                    they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such
                    as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it
                    should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff
                    member(s).
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by volunteer staff, venue
                    staff, or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law
                    enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if
                    they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter’s privacy by not
                    sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who
                    were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After resolving the issue, a CoC report should be written and
                    submitted to
                    <a href="mailto:conduct@pspython.com">conduct@pspython.com</a>
                    as soon as possible, so that the information can be logged and
                    included in transparency reports. The report should be written
                    according to the
                    <a href="/code-of-conduct-reporting-guide">Code of Conduct Reporting Guide</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Warnings</h3>

                <p>
                    Any member of volunteer staff can issue a verbal warning to a
                    participant that their behavior violates the Code of Conduct.
                </p>

                <h3>Expulsion</h3>

                <p>
                    A participant may be expelled by the decision of volunteer staff
                    and at their discretion. Here are some general guidelines for when
                    a participant should be expelled:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A third offense that resulted in a warning from staff</li>

                    <li>Continuing to harass after any &quot;No&quot; or
                        &quot;Stop&quot; instruction
                    </li>

                    <li>A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings</li>

                    <li>A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)</li>

                    <li>A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In addition, hotel/venue security and local authorities should be
                    contacted when appropriate.
                </p>

                <h2>CoC violations in community spaces</h2>

                <p>
                    In case someone reports a code of conduct violation outside
                    meetups or events, in one of the PuPPy online spaces, or
                    otherwise by email.
                </p>

                <h3>Initial receipt</h3>

                <p>Reports must be acknowledged as received within 24 hours or sooner.</p>

                <p>The staff must to review the incident and determine the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What happened.</li>

                    <li>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.</li>

                    <li>Who the bad actor was.</li>

                    <li>Whether this is an ongoing situation</li>

                    <li>If there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    After the staff has a complete account of the events they need to
                    make a decision as to how to resolve the case. Resolutions might
                    include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>

                    <li>A private reprimand from the staff to the individual(s) involved.</li>

                    <li>A public reprimand.</li>

                    <li>
                        An imposed vacation (for example, asking someone to &quot;take
                        a week off&quot; from Slack or the forum).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A permanent or temporary ban from some or all PuPPy spaces
                        (Slack, meetups, or other events).
                    </li>

                    <li>A request for a public or private apology.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    A response must be sent within one week to the person who filed the
                    report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the
                    situation is not yet resolved.
                </p>

                <h3>Public statements</h3>

                <p>
                    As a general rule, volunteer staff should not make any public
                    statements about the behavior of individual people during or after
                    the event. After each event, a CoC transparency report
                    will be published with anonymized information about any violations
                    that might have occured.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This report should be handled with care not to divulge personally
                    identifying information about victims, reporters, and violators,
                    and should serve as a means to ensure that attendees will be
                    comfortable reporting harassment and that our community will be
                    kept accountable for supporting and encouraging safe spaces.
