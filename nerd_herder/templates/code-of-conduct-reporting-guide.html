                            In any PuPPy space (events or online), if you believe someone
                            is violating the <a href="/pages/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>,
                            we ask that you report it to the staff by emailing
                            <a href="mailto:conduct@pspython.com">conduct@pspython.com</a>
                            or reporting to a staff person in person, if possible.
                            All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may
                            determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that’s
                            the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain
                            confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify
                            appropriate law enforcement first. If you are unsure which law
                            enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your
                            report and we will attempt to notify them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If the violation occurs at an event (such as workshop, meetup),
                            get in touch with one of the event staff right away, in any of the
                            following ways:

                                Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we
                                need to follow up)

                                pseudonyms). If there were other witnesses besides you, please
                                try to include them as well.

                                possible.
                            </li>

                                Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available
                                record (e.g., a mailing list archive or a public chat logger)
                                please include a link. Our Slack Team is currently on a free plan
                                that does not retain more than 10,000 messages of history, if an
                                incident occurred on Slack please take a screenshot so it is not
                                lost.

                        <h2>What happens after you file a report</h2>

                        <p>
                            The PuPPy community team aims to follow the process
                            outlined in the
                            <a href="/pages/code-of-conduct/response-playbook">Code of Conduct
                                Response Playbook</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We promise to acknowledge receipt of any reports within 24 hours or
                            sooner, and a resolution (or update in case a resolution is
                            delayed) within 7 days.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Note: If the violation is determined to be an ongoing incident or a
                            threat to physical safety, the staff’s immediate priority will be
                            to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an
                            &quot;official&quot; response until we believe that the situation
                            has ended and that everyone is physically safe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once we determine the final needed action, we’ll contact the
                            original reporter to let them know what action we’ll be taking, if
                            any. Please understand that while we take into account feedback
                            from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, we cannot
                            guarantee we can or will act on it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, the staff may choose to make a public report of the
                            incident if it was reported outside one of our conferences.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To
